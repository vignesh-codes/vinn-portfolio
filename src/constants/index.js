export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a self-taught programmer who discovered a passion for coding during the pandemic. What started as a way to pass time in quarantine quickly turned into a journey into backend engineering. I've had the privilege of working with several well-funded startups, where I gained hands-on experience in designing, building, and deploying cloud-based microservices from the ground up. Recently, I've ventured into frontend technologies and I'm enjoying the learning process. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Software Engineering at Western University, Ontario.`;
